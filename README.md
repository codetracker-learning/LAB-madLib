# MadLib Challenge

This challenge will get you thinking about problems and how to use data. 

There are multiple ways to complete this project, so use what you know and learn from others. 

## The Riddle:
`
In the book War of the NOUN (PLURAL) , the main character is an anonymous OCCUPATION who records the arrival of ANIMAL (PLURAL) in PLACE. Needless to say, havoc reigns as the ANIMAL (PLURAL) continue to VERB everything in sight, until they are killed by the common NOUN.
`

## Acceptance Criteria
- Implement Bootstrap Styles
- A form that accepts user input
- On submit of the form, remove the form from the DOM and show the riddle with the user input in **BOLD**
- On the riddle view, there is a button that allows the user to try again.
- On press of the try again button, the riddle is removed from the DOM and the form is on the DOM
- After completing all functionality, add your own style to the app.

## The Data
You can use any data structure for your data. Here is an example of the data in an array.

```javascript
const libArray = [
  "plural-noun",
  "occupation",
  "animal-plural",
  "place",
  "verb",
  "noun"
];
```
